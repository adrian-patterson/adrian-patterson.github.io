# Small Beginnings

The story of the IoT Control Center starts with a breadboard, a blue LED, a Rasbperry Pi, and the stress of a looming internship on the horizon.

With my first internship approaching, I was nervous and excited to start working on real-world software engineering challenges. 

**The problem**: I had no idea what the words C#, .NET, microservices, etc., all meant. My solution? To start tinkering with these technologies along with my Raspberry Pi to learn how these technologies worked.

The goal was simple: Have a user interface with a button to turn an LED on and off. After days (possibly months -- I don't remember), I finally got it. A working proof-of-concept! From my phone, I was able to click a button and turn on an LED. 

At the time, this was absolutely thrilling for me. I turned a bunch of text on a screen into something that can physically interact with the world! There were so many possibilities from here...

Armed with this working demo, I embarked on a journey to scale this simple LED light to support multiple devices, like light bulbs, outlets, etc. I envisioned a home-automation application to the likes of Jarvis. Complete control over my house's devices, custom-built the way I want it.

Oblivious to the mountain of work ahead for what I had in mind, I embarked on this journey to build what I called the IoT Control Center, or ICC for short.

# Design and Architecting

I actually didn't further pursue the project until after my internship. What I initially built was simple.

Have you ever heard of Home Assistant? Well, I didn't.

Once I found it, all my hard work melted away into a river of lost time. But, not all was lost. I learned so many valuable lessons and
