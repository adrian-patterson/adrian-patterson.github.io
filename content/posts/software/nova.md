# Nova Browser - Support

## What is Nova Browser?

Nova Browser is a minimalist web browser designed for people who have removed traditional browsers from their phones to maintain focus and avoid digital distractions. It provides emergency web access without the features that enable mindless browsing.

## How It Works

Nova Browser is intentionally simple:

1. Open the app
2. Enter or paste a URL
3. Tap "Go" to view the page
4. Close the app when finished

When you close Nova Browser, all data is cleared automatically—no history, cookies, or cached data is saved.

## Key Features

- **No Browsing History**: Nothing is saved between sessions
- **No Saved Logins**: Prevents staying logged into social media
- **Auto-Clear Data**: All cookies and cache are erased when you close the app
- **Minimal Interface**: Just a URL input and a "Go" button

## Who Is This For?

Nova Browser is perfect for:

- Digital minimalists who removed browsers from their phones
- People recovering from social media addiction
- Anyone practicing intentional phone usage
- Parents wanting emergency-only web access for their kids
- People doing a digital detox while maintaining basic connectivity

## Privacy

Nova Browser doesn't collect, store, or transmit any data. There are no analytics, no tracking, and no servers. Everything you view stays on your device until you close the app—then it's completely erased.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I save bookmarks or passwords?**  
A: No. Nova Browser intentionally doesn't save anything to prevent habit formation.

**Q: Does it save my browsing history?**  
A: No. All data is cleared when you close the app.

**Q: Can I use it to stay logged into websites?**  
A: No. This is by design to prevent mindless social media checking.

**Q: Why not just use Safari in private mode?**  
A: Safari still has tabs, bookmarks, and features that enable extended browsing sessions. Nova Browser is deliberately minimal.

## Technical Details

- Built with React Native and Expo
- Uses react-native-webview for in-app browsing
